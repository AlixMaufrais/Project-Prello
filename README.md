# Project-Prello

## Brief

Prello is a Proptech founded in 2021, specialized in the sale and management of second homes. Their main objective is to revolutionize the second home market with the possibility to buy in co-purchase or single purchase. All services as legal base, works, airbnb rental management, management between co-owners are included.

As Prello cannot cover all the territory, the company needs to target the best areas for them to deploy property hunters. We are asking you to create a French towns scoring in order to rank cities from the most interesting one to the least. Fortunately there are plenty open source data available in France. You will use them to build your model.

You will need to think about best KPIs to construct your score. 
Imagine **several investors profiles** and give them **recommandations** based on your analysis.

Create a **dashboard to easily compare cities from different angles**.

## Team

We were 4 in the team to work together.

## Tools used

We decided to use **BigQuery** to stock the tables, **DBT** to clean, analyse and transform the data and **Github** to push and merge our requests.
Then we used **Looker Studio** for the data visualisation.
